# Harry Potter Character Quiz
## ITG JavaScript group project: NPM, Webpack, API, Sass, BEM
### Overview
This project is developed by a group of four students as an educational endeavour completed within one week. It uses a [free API](https://hp-api.onrender.com/), and leverages technologies such as npm, Webpack, and SCSS preprocessor. The primary language is JavaScript. Our team also designed the layout using Figma, resulting in a fun and interactive web page.
### Description
The main page of our project sets the theme: "What character are you today?" 

Users are presented with a CSS-animated start button. When clicking it they receive information about a randomly selected character from the Harry Potter universe, fetched from the [API]((https://hp-api.onrender.com/)). It's a delightful quiz for all Harry Potter fans, allowing them to discover which character aligns with their mood on any given day. 

Our other learning focus was on the use of media queries for ensuring an adaptive and responsive behaviour of the page. We developed it using the â€œdesktop-first" principle. Creating this page we also deployed a lot of absolute and relative positioning and used CSS Flexbox technique.
### Features
- **Random Character Selection**: Users can click the "Start" button to get a surprise character from the Harry Potter Universe.
- **Interactive Layout**: The project boasts an engaging and user-friendly design, crafted with Figma to provide an immersive experience.
- **Informative Content**: The API fetches details about each character, including their name, house, species, ancestry, year of birth, and actor.
- **Technological Stack**: We used JavaScript for interactivity, npm for package management, Webpack for seamless bundling, and SCSS for maintaining a structured and organized CSS codebase.
